# Virtual_CPU_Emulator
**Overview:** This project builds a Virtual CPU Emulator to simulate essential CPU components and operations. It covers Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), ALU, memory management, and I/O operations, following a 10-week structured plan.

**Goals:** 1. Develop a virtual CPU with core functionalities.
2. Implement basic instructions (ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE).
3. Create a testing environment for assembly programs.

**Collaboration:** Our team uses GitHub for version control and progress tracking.
