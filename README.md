**Overview:** This project builds a Virtual CPU Emulator to simulate essential CPU components and operations. It covers Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), ALU, memory management, and I/O operations, following a 10-week structured plan.

**Goals:** 
- 1. Develop a virtual CPU with core functionalities.
  2. Implement basic instructions (ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE).
  3. Create a testing environment for assembly programs.

# Objective üéØ
The Virtual CPU Emulator is intended to be a simplified, more interactive source for learning about and experimenting with CPU architectures and the execution of their instructions. The project simulates basic CPU operations, the project aims to:
- Learning computer architecture and low-level programming.
- Allows safe experimentation with assembly and instruction set.
- Tool for debugging and analyzing instruction execution in a controlled virtual environment.
- Assisting teachers and students in visualizing and experimenting with the underlying concepts of CPU functionality.
The emulation aims not only at this but also seeks to connect theory with practice truly processors work in fundamentals.
